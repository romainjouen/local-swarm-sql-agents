## User query
what has been viewed between '2023-04-13' and '2023-04-15 11:00:00' give the results in a bar chart, user name in axis x, hour of likes in y axis and color by item name (python code)

## Result
To create a bar chart with the given data using Python, we can use libraries such as `matplotlib` and `pandas`. Here's how you could do it:

First, let's assume the data is retrieved in a list of dictionaries format and then converted to a DataFrame. We will extract hours from `hour_of_likes` and plot accordingly.

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample Data (Assuming this comes from your database query)
data = [
    {"username": "alice_ai", "hour_of_likes": "2023-04-15 10:00:00", "view_count": 2},
    {"username": "bob_ml", "hour_of_likes": "2023-04-14 14:00:00", "view_count": 1},
    {"username": "charlie_nlp", "hour_of_likes": "2023-04-13 16:00:00", "view_count": 1}
]

# Convert the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Extract hours from 'hour_of_likes' column and store them in a new column called 'hour'
df['hour'] = pd.to_datetime(df['hour_of_likes']).dt.hour

# Pivot table to create a suitable format for plotting
pivot_df = df.pivot_table(index='hour', columns='username', values='view_count', fill_value=0)

# Plotting using matplotlib
pivot_df.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(12, 6))
plt.xlabel('Hour of Likes')
plt.ylabel('View Count')
plt.title('Views between 2023-04-13 and 2023-04-15 11:00:00 (User Wise)')
plt.legend(title='Username')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **DataFrame Creation:** We create a DataFrame with the sample data from your query.
2. **Hour Extraction:** We extract the hour information from `hour_of_likes` and store it in a new column named `hour`.
3. **Pivot Table:** Convert the data into a pivot table format where each username's view count is organized according to hours.
4. **Plotting:** Using `matplotlib`, we plot this pivot table as a stacked bar chart, where each stack represents a different user.

To run this code you will need to have Python installed along with `pandas` and `matplotlib`. You can install these libraries using pip if they are not already installed:
```
pip install pandas matplotlib
```
